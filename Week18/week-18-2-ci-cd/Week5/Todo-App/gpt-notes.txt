// Improvised notes of mine in organised manner   
Creating a Todo App
Backend
Initialize Node Project:

Start by initializing a Node.js project.
Create a package.json file using npm init.
Install Express:

Install Express using npm install express.
Add "express" to the dependencies in your package.json file.
Middleware and Boilerplate Code:

Create index.js and set up the Express server with middleware and basic route handling.
Data Validation with Zod:

Install Zod using npm install zod.
Create validation functions using Zod for the expected request data.
Implement validation checks in the route handlers.
MongoDB Integration:

Install Mongoose for MongoDB integration using npm install mongoose.
Define MongoDB schemas and models.
Write logic for handling CRUD operations with MongoDB.
Handling CORS:

Install CORS middleware using npm install cors.
Configure CORS to allow requests from specific origins using app.use(cors({ origin: "" })).
Handling JSON Data:

Use app.use(express.json()) to enable Express to parse JSON data from requests.
Set headers for JSON data in the response (Content-Type: application/json).
Backend Organization:

Organize the project with separate files for validation, database operations, and main routes.
Frontend
Create React Project:

Set up a React project in the "frontend" directory using npx create-react-app frontend.
Remove unnecessary files and folders.
Component Structure:

Create functional components for the Todo app: CreateTodo, TodoList, and Todo.
Organize components within a "components" directory.
Component Styling:

Apply basic styling to components using inline styles or CSS modules.
State Management:

Use React state to manage data within components.
Implement state updates based on user input and server responses.
Axios for API Requests:

Install Axios for making HTTP requests using npm install axios.
Use Axios for both GET and POST requests to the backend.
Handling User Input:

Utilize onChange events to capture user input for creating a new todo.
Use onClick events to trigger POST requests to the server.
Effective Data Fetching with useEffect:

Introduce the useEffect hook to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
Use useEffect to fetch data from the backend and update state.
Alternative State Management (React Query):

Mention React Query as an alternative for efficient data fetching and management.
Conclusion:
